- Network risk The transaction of membership passes (NFT) is conducted using the blockchain system, so it may take some time to grant the membership pass (NFT), and there is a risk that the granting of the membership pass (NFT) may not be reflected in the address or that the granting of the membership pass (NFT) may be canceled.
